🚀 Excited to share my latest project! 🚀

As part of my internship at Cognifyz Technologies, I built a Full-Stack Internship Application that demonstrates my skills in web development. Key highlights:

🔹 Frontend: EJS (Embedded JavaScript)

🔹 Backend: Node.js with Express

🔹 Database: PostgreSQL

🔹 Features:

📄 Form to submit internship applications (name, email, phone, address, university, degree, position, and cover letter)

📎 Resume upload functionality using Multer for file handling

🎨 User-friendly UI with responsive design

🔒 Data stored securely in a PostgreSQL database

✅ Success page displaying submitted data and providing a download link for the uploaded resume

🔹 Technologies Used:

💻 Node.js & Express for the server-side logic

🗃️ PostgreSQL for storing form data

📤 Multer for handling file uploads (resumes)

⚙️ EJS for rendering dynamic content on the frontend

🎨 CSS for styling with a clean and modern design
